Java Internship Task 9 – Student Management System

This project demonstrates:
- ArrayList for storing objects
- HashSet for removing duplicates
- HashMap for fast lookup
- Comparator for sorting
- Enhanced for-loop
- Formatted student reports

This task helped me understand Java Collections Framework deeply.
